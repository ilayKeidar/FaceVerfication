Face Verification Using a Siamese Neural Network. 

By using large amounts of data, images of faces of both myself and other people, and building a siamese neural network, I was able to take a photo of myself and receive as an output that Iâ€™m verified, and when a different person tries - they are unverified. 

This project is written in python and mainly uses the libraries TensorFlow, Keras, and OpenCV
